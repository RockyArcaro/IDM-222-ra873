                            <p> A project in my Interactive Digital Media course was to redesign a pre-existing website. I chose a local tavern that I knew could use some reworking. The logo on their website currently is incredibly small and hard to see, so in my redesign, I made a higher resolution version of their logo so it can be used at a larger size for their viewers to recognize!</p>

                <p>Another Good Idea Fund Project, The first bash is a welcome week event for Drexel University freshman as they get first acclimated to college life. Our theme this past year was a carnival and I did my best to make Drexel themed carnival posters, social media posts, and this year we had tote bags made with a similar design. </p>

                <p>The Reflect Roundtable was a mental health event held by Sigma Phi Epsilon along with the Honors College. Students would talk in groups about certain topics that might be stressful or problematic for college students such as readjusting to a new home, meeting new people, getting involved, etc. We did our best to market this event all over campus which again required designs by myself to be made for posters, and social media. </p>

                <p>Similarly to fall recruitment, I was in charge of marketing material for Spring Recruitment of 2022. The group decided on space as their theme and I again made shirts, banners, cards, and other marketing material to promote the organization. </p>
